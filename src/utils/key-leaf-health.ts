/**
 * @file src/utils/key-leaf-health.ts
 * @description Health checks shared by every durable key leaf (the operation
 * and preparation key epochs, and the lifecycle key observation). A key leaf is
 * healthy only when it is mode 0600, owned by the current user, and linked
 * exactly once, or exactly twice through one named protocol-owned companion
 * alias left behind by a durable no-replace write. Recovery of a synced
 * ready-only crash key reuses its bytes; incomplete scratch bytes are disposable.
